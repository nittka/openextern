# openextern
Automatically exported from code.google.com/p/openextern

We used this plugin for quite some time and found it very useful.
There seems to have been no further development on this plugin.
All automatic imports from https://code.google.com/archive/p/openextern/ to github show no further commits.

This fork is intended to enhance the open extern functions with respect to Egit's Repositories view.
It will not provide a corresponding update site.

The plugin.xml and classes have been updated to use the command/handler extension points:

* improved menu entry visibility check
* adapt to java.io.File as well
